# HR EMPLOYEE ATTRITION ANALYSIS REPORT 
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of employee attrition using an HR dataset. The analysis was designed to understand turnover patterns, identify high-risk employee categories, and generate strategic recommendations for improving retention.
The workflow followed four stages:
- Excel for preliminary data preparation,
- SQL for query-based exploration and validation,
- PowerPoint for custom dashboard background design,
- Power BI for building an interactive, insight-driven visualization.

## *Aim & Objectives*
*Aim:*
To analyze workforce attrition and uncover the key factors driving employee turnover.

*Objectives*
- Analyze overall employee distribution and attrition behavior.
- Study attrition patterns across demographic and job-related attributes.
- Visualize relationships such as job satisfaction, hourly rate, age, and travel frequency.
- Build an interactive dashboard that simplifies HR decision-making.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations for reducing attrition.

*Key Metrics & Indicators (KPIs)*
The dashboard highlights the following key metrics:
- Total Employee Count: 1,470
- Attrition Count: 1,470 
- Average Age: 36.92 years
- Attrition by Gender
- Attrition by Department
- Attrition by Job Role

- Sum of Hourly Rate
- Sum of Job Satisfaction
- Business Travel Segmentation
These KPIs provide a snapshot of workforce structure, turnover risks, and employee engagement levels.

## *Insights & Findings*
1. *Departmental Attrition Patterns*
Attrition is highest in the Sales and Research & Development departments.
The HR department shows significantly lower attrition.
This pattern suggests heavier workloads or job dissatisfaction in certain units.
2. *Gender-Based Attrition*
Male employees account for a larger share of attrition compared to females.
This may indicate differences in role distribution or workload pressures.
3. *Education Field Impact*
Employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds represent the highest attrition counts.
Fields such as HR and Marketing record fewer exits.
This suggests competitive industry pull or unmet job expectations.
 4. * Effect of Business Travel*
Frequent travelers exhibit higher attrition than those who rarely travel or do not travel at all.
Work-life imbalance or travel stress may be contributing factors.
5. *Attrition by Job Role*
Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians show the highest attrition levels.
Roles requiring higher specialization, such as Research Scientists, show lower turnover.
Entry-level or high-pressure positions appear more vulnerable to churn.
6. *Job Satisfaction Analysis*
Variation in job satisfaction scores aligns with attrition patterns.
Roles with lower satisfaction scores correlate with higher turnover.
7. *Age and Compensation Observations*
The average employee age is 36.92 years.
Differences in hourly rate across education levels and roles may influence attrition.
Lower compensation roles show higher turnover tendencies.

   ## *Recommendations & Action Points*
1. Strengthen support in high-attrition departments:
Rebalance workloads and evaluate operational bottlenecks.
Improve leadership and communication frameworks.
Offer departmental incentives and structured career pathways.
2. Reduce burnout among frequent travelers:
Limit unnecessary travel.
Expand remote or virtual meeting options.
Introduce travel benefits or wellness programs.
3. Focus retention efforts on high-risk roles:
Improve compensation and benefits for Sales Executives and Laboratory Technicians.
Offer training, mentorship, and personal development opportunities.
Clarify promotion expectations to increase career visibility.
4. Increase engagement and satisfaction levels:
Implement recognition programs.
Conduct regular feedback and performance discussions.
Provide work-life-balance initiatives.
5. Review compensation fairness:
Conduct a salary benchmarking exercise.
Adjust hourly rate structures to reflect job difficulty and market trends.
6. Establish ongoing attrition monitoring:
Use BI dashboards to track monthly turnover patterns.
Apply predictive models to identify employees at risk.
Align HR policies with data-driven insights.

## *Conclusion & Summary*
The HR Employee Attrition Analysis highlights clear turnover patterns across departments, job roles, education fields, and travel frequencies. The insights reveal that frontline roles, frequent travelers, and certain backgrounds experience higher attrition. These findings support the need for targeted engagement, workload balance, compensation review, and continuous monitoring.
By applying the recommended strategies, organizations can significantly improve employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and optimize workforce stability.
